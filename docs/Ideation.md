title: Ideation and Concept Generation

## Background Information

### Exhibit Goals
The goal of the team's exhibit is to demonstrate atleast one STEM-based concept in an interactive, web-enabled, physical device. This will require describing how the team's prototype functions along with focusing on the viewer's attention with interactive displays and buttons. The exhibit must also demonstrate a physical action, where pressing the button will activate the device. Another exhibit goal involves engaging the viewer with self-testing and focusing on their attention. This will allow viewers to test their knowledge with the prototype. The prototype must consist of atleast four subsystems, with atleast one individual functionality, microcontroller, 3.3V Switching regulator, and in circuit programming circuitry.
### Target Audience
The prototype will be demonstrated at the Innovation Showcase, with the intended audience being for ASU alumni, industry professionals, and other ASU students. The target audience is intended for students K-12 interested in learning about science, technology, engineering, or math. The goal is to inspire new generations and foster curiousity about STEM fields through an interactive experience that highlights innovation.
## Ideation
The team performed a product brainstorm to generate 100 ideas on possible products for the project. The team considered durability, safety, and comfort when generating ideas. The team used Padlet to collaborate and generate the ideas. After the 100 ideas were generated, the team grouped ideas thematically, ranking top ideas and combining ideas together to possibly generate new ones. Below are pictures from the brainstorming session along with the grouping process.

## Concept Generation

Our motor-controlled solar panel aims to create an engaging and educational experience for students in grades K-12. Our design utilizes two separate solar panels attached to a moving bi-directional motor. This motor can be controlled via buttons that the user can control. This offers an interactive experience so that students can learn by doing. The buttons will be made as simple as possible with forward and reverse instructions alongside simple instructions printed alongside them. The confusing operation will be no problem because of its straightforward intuitive design processes that we strive to push throughout the entire design. Photo resistive sensors will also be integrated into the product to detect light. This provides a way for the solar panel to track the light it sees and read it to the OLED display. Both brightness and power will be shown on this OLED screen for viewers to see which will be read from the solar panels and sensors. This product also utilizes innovative WI-FI capabilities using a two-way connection interface. Students can use their mobile devices to control the motors themselves. Younger students will cherish this tangible interaction even more so than the button operations as mentioned previously. This interactive app will also be aimed at common sense and intuition. Frustrating apps drive customers and consumers away, so it is important to our team that we get this to be a smooth and simple operation for all who come across it.

Since this will be handled by many students of varying age groups, safety is one of our top priorities. In case something goes wacky with the motors we will ensure all software is bug-free and safe for the public to utilize to its fullest potential. This device will also be made to be durable so it can be picked up and held by younger members. Also, in case of accidental roughhousing, the device will still be functional so that everyone in the museum will still get to view and collaborate with this cool project. As far as breaking this project into manageable groups, it will be split among the four team members. The categories are as follows. The motor, the sensors, and solar panels, the user interface including the OLED and button functionality, and the power source and WI-FI capability. This is split in a way so that each member has an equal and fair amount of work to handle throughout the semester.
